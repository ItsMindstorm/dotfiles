# dotfiles
Just a repository with my configs

The hyprland dotfiles are from [ChrisTitus](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/hyprland-titus) which I modified for my own use.

This also uses home-manager in combination with nix package manager, to be able to use fish as default shell, add the shell to the /etc/shells file.

``` 
chsh -s /home/youruser/.nix-profile/bin/fish
```
